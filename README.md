# The Wild Oasis

## Web application for hotel employees :blush:

### Technologies stack:
+ React
+ React Router
+ Context API
+ Tanstack (React) query V5
+ Styled components :nail_care:
+ React hook form
+ React icons
+ Hot toasts
+ Recharts

Also I've learned how to deal with databases, and now I can use Supabase in every my project without problems at all
### I've implemented the Guests page, where you can create a new guest (as you can guess), and on the main page you can book this new guest a room. I think I did it right, this part wasn't in the course
